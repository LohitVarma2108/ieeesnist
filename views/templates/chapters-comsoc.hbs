                        Communications society was established in 1952. With the formation of IRE’s (the Institute of Radio Engineers)
                        Professional Group on Communications Systems (PGCS), Communications Society under IEEE has evolved into a diversified
                        group of global industry professionals with a common objective in advancing all communications technologies.

                    <p>
                        Communications Society (ComSoc) under IEEE – SNIST SB was, initiated in the year 2017. The main motto of establishing
                        Communications Society under IEEE – SNIST SB was to make a developing engineer understand the seamless connection between
                        Electronics and Communication. It also aims in improvisation of innovative thinking of a student regarding practical
                        working and diverse applications in the practical world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Communications Society under IEEE – SNIST SB, aims to prepare an engineer in all possible ways to make him/her field
                        ready. In the previous years, Communications Society under IEEE – SNIST SB has organized few events that were not only
                        knowledgeable but were also fruitful to the engineers of SNIST and to the students of many other colleges. With a good
                        membership base of around 20 members, including the Executive Committee and the volunteers, ComSoc IEEE – SNIST SB, has
                        made a profound impact on many engineers over the years with unique and innovative events.
